## Homework - Putting it all together

- Continuing building on portfolio

- We're going to have five main sections:
  1. Header - title and logo
  2. Left sidebar - site nav, should float left and have a width of 25%
  3. Main body - the meat of your page, should include a few paragraphs
  4. Right sidebar - external links, should float right have a width of 25%
  5. Footer - more site nav
 
- Add a simple contact form and use (TODO) as your form action

- Play around with different color and font schemes
